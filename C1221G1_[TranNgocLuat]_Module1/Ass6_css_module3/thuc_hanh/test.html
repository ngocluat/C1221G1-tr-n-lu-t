<p> tTip: The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma. Read more about fallback fonts in the next chapter.

    Example
    Specify some different fonts for three paragraphs:

    .p1 {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    }

    .p2 {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    }

    .p3 {
    font-family: "Lucida Console", "Courier New", monospace;
    }
